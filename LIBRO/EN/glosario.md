# Glossary of Cosmogonical Terms

* **Event Horizon**: The point of no return. In physics, the boundary around a black hole where escape velocity equals the speed of light. In this book, it is the threshold where hope is physically extinguished.
* **Quantum Information Law**: The principle that information cannot be destroyed. Here, it means no sin disappears; everything is recorded on the horizon surface, an eternal memory of error.
* **Black Hole**: An object with gravity so intense that nothing escapes. The final receptacle, the consummate hell where space and time exchange functions.
* **Quasar**: An active galactic nucleus. The thermal scream of a black hole feeding on matter; a hell that spits energy because it cannot contain all the pain it tries to swallow.
* **Pulsar**: A rapidly rotating neutron star. The metronome of the void, a rhythmic reminder that time, though dilated, continues to mark the sentence.
* **Singularity**: The point of infinite density at the center of a black hole. Where the laws of physics die and only the will of the abyss remains.
* **Hawking Radiation**: Process by which a black hole loses mass. The ultimate wear of the soul.
* **Entropy**: Measure of disorder. The force that strips the condemned of identity.
