# Chapter 1: The Geometry of Hell

The error of modern science was believing the event horizon was merely a physical boundary. They failed to understand that extreme gravity is the physical manifestation of absolute despair. 

A **black hole** is not a "cosmic vacuum"; it is a receptacle of souls where time stops so that punishment may never end. If light cannot escape, it is because in hell there is no room for hope or enlightenment. On the other hand, **quasars** are the scream of those hells that failed to close, thermal machines of a pain that overflows without ever being consumed: failed hells.
